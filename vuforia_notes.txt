I did a test with the RC phone pointed directly at a laptop screen (I don't have a color printer). I recorded the distances, in mm, both reported by the code and measured with a measuring tape. I calculated the ratio of the latter to the former. The ratio was fairly consistent, so this may be a usable technique.

Reported   Measured  Factor
1228        711.2    0.58
2078       1287.7    0.61

There are limitations - the images couldn't be recognized beyond a reported distance of appx 2400mm (actual distance of ~1400mm). So the technique may be best used when combined with other techniques of estimating position, such as odometry, or using sensors to detect the colored tape, etc.
